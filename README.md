# Mobile Flashcards

Mobile Flashcards is a React Native application that allows users to quiz themselves on decks of flashcards. The app requires no network connection as it uses the device's local storage to hold the user's decks and cards. The app has been tested for iOS and Android.

To use: clone or download the project, navigate to the root directory, run ```yarn install``` (or ```npm install```) to install third party dependencies, and run ```yarn start``` (or ```npm start```) to start the app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
